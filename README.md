# Assignment: JavaScript Web APIs - Code Quiz

  SkillHat - February 2024

## Your Task

At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this module, this Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

This week’s coursework will equip you with all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

## User Story

```
AS A coding student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
### The process
To ensure an effective quiz is generated, the following was done:
*Create two HTML files (one to take quiz and one to view scores)
*Add CSS elements to make the quiz's theme purple
*Create two JavaScript files (one containing functions to execute the quiz and one to store previous scores)
*Modify HTML file to dynamically work with JavaScript file


### The result

After modifying the JavaSript file, a timed coding quiz with a a clean, polished, and responsive user interface has been provided
